Because Brian, you enjoy\\nnot having a clue about the Bible.   \\n\\n\\n\\nCan you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and\\nconcern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers\\nto you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,\\nthen you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid\\nof your emotions.\\n\\nAnd I do have a good reason to believe what I do.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my\\nGod says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have\\nlife forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal\\ntorment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to \\nlive it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that\\nwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It\\'s\\nwishful thinking.\\n \\n\\nIs this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most\\npeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they\\nare imperfect.  Is \"the world an undesireable place\" a doctrine\\nof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does\\nKendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?\\nMine doesn\\'t.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  \\nMine doesn\\'t.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the\\npriest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn\\'t.  Is this\\na bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being \\nignorant of the Bible?\\n\\nBrian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.\\nYou would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don\\'t follow Kendigianism.\\nI follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance\\nof Christ and the Bible in regards to \"priests\",  have you not read about\\nthe sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the\\npurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should\\nNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do\\nnot follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\"  I follow Christ.\\n\\n\\nWhy would you want to live a good life?\\nTo you, you die and that\\'s it.  Don\\'t contradict yourself.  You have\\nno reason to live a good life.  It doesn\\'t do you any good in the\\nend.  Your life doesn\\'t do anybody else any good  either because\\neveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\\na good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\\n\\n\\nHas the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.\\nJesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system\\nin its every detail.  Jesus\\'s death was like a seed.  He needed\\nto fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did\\nyou miss the entire John passage as well?  \\n\\n\\n\\nForget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget\\nthat I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know\\nhow to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I\\nexist.  .\\n'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
